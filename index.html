            Hello, my name is haya shibli, i am 22 years old a fresh graduate from the university of jordan with a
            bachelor's degree in the
            science of orthotics and prosthetics, i trained 4 months at al-bashir hospital in 2018-2019. Now i am taking
            an intensive course in
            software development at ASAC. My main goal after i become a full stacked software developer is to use
            software development
            to make applications and websites that will help and improve the field of orthotics and prosthetics.
